### I believe that everyone should have access to clean, fresh water.


> First of all, it is necessary for survival to have clean water and safe food. Lots of black and/or poor people do not have clean water because of racism and water costs. [^1]


> Second of all, I believe that all people should have the right to clean water. In my opinion, this should be a basic human right and not a privilege. In fact, in 2010, the United Nations decided that clean water is a basic human right.[^2]
Unfortunately, the U.S. and 40 other countries opted out of this. In all of U.S. law, the closest thing to the statement that clean water is a basic human right is in the California water code, where it says that it is a right, but then a little bit later, it says that the state is not really required to provide clean water.[^3]


### Some things we can do to help


1. Give homeless people lifestraws, if not clean water, to filter out germs and contamination from water
2. Try to end racism; Things such as the *Black Lives Matter* campaign
