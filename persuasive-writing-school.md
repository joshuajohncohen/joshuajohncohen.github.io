# My persuasive writing

### I believe that everyone should have access to clean, fresh water.


> It is necessary for survival to have easy access to clean water. Unfortunately, many indiginous, minority and/or low income Americans do not have clean water because of enviromental racism. [^1] I believe that all people - regardless of race, ethnicity, income or class - should have the right to clean water. In my opinion, this should be a basic human right; not a privilege, and certainly not a white privilege. 
> In 2010, the United Nations actually decided that clean water is a basic human right.[^2]
Unfortunately, the U.S. and 40 other countries opted out of this. In all of U.S. law, the closest thing to the statement that clean water is a basic human right is in the California water code, where it says that it is a right, but then a little bit later, it says that the state is not really required to provide clean water.[^3] I believe that it is the responsibility of our federal government to ensure access to clean water for all Americans.
