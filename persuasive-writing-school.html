<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">First of all, it is necessary for survival to have clean water and safe food. Lots of homeless people are forced to take the risk of drinking dirty water because it’s the only water they have. As a result of this, lots of homeless people get sick or die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="10">Second of all, I believe that all people should have the right to clean water. In my opinion, this should be a basic human right and not a privilege. In fact, in 2010, the United Nations decided that clean water is a basic human right.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup><br>
Unfortunately, the U.S. and 40 other countries opted out of this. In all of U.S. law, the closest thing to the statement that clean water is a basic human right is in the California water code, where it says that it is a right, but then a little bit later, it says that the state is not really required to provide clean water.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
